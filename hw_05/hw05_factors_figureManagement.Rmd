### Define factor variables
> The function factor is used to encode a vector as a factor (the terms ‘category’ and ‘enumerated type’ are also used for factors)


*Taking a quick look at the dataset*
```{r}
sapply(singer_locations, function(x) length(unique(x)))
```

By looking at the dataframe, I decided that the columns for year, name and city would be good variables to cast as factors because they are discrete. Using the base as.factor() function coerces missing values to NA automatically. For forcats::as_factor(), there are limitations to the values that can be used in the function.

Note: forcats::as_factor() can't be applied to numeric objects, or NA values - producing the following errors:

 - *Error in UseMethod("as_factor") : no applicable method for 'as_factor' applied to an object of class "c('integer', 'numeric')"*

 - *Error: `idx` must contain one integer for each level of `f`*

To solve these errors I casted the year variable to characters, and explicitly marked NA values. I initially changed NA values in the catagorical variables to the string "NA" before converting to factor by using the following ifelse statement: `mutate(city_forcat_fct = ifelse(is.na(city), "NA", city), city = as_factor(city_forcat_fct))`. 
I  later found found the fct_explicit_na() function which essentially combines the two mutate statements into one.

```{r}
singer_factors <- singer_locations %>% 
      mutate(year_base_fct = as.factor(year),
             name_base_fct = as.factor(name),
             city_base_fct = as.factor(city),
             year_forcat_fct = as_factor(as.character(year)),
             name_forcat_fct = fct_explicit_na(name, na_level = "(NA)"),
             city_forcat_fct = fct_explicit_na(city, na_level = "(NA)"))

## For sanity check
glimpse(singer_factors)
singer_factors %>% 
      select(year, year_base_fct, year_forcat_fct, 
             name, name_base_fct, name_forcat_fct,
             city, city_base_fct, city_forcat_fct) %>% 
      head() %>% 
      kable(align = "c")
```



### Drop 0
Filter the singer_locations data to remove observations associated with the uncorrectly inputed  year 0. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and levels; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

Looking at the singer_factor dataframe, I'm going to look at the same 3 variable is chose to manipulate in the previous step.

```{r}
with_0 <- singer_factors %>% 
      select(year_forcat_fct, name_forcat_fct, city_forcat_fct) %>% 
      summarise_all(funs(length, nlevels)) %>% 
      mutate(datatype = "Before dropping 0")

dropped_0 <- singer_factors %>% 
      select(year_forcat_fct, name_forcat_fct, city_forcat_fct) %>% 
      filter(year_forcat_fct != 0) %>% 
      droplevels() %>% 
      summarise_all(funs(length, nlevels)) %>% 
      mutate(datatype = "After dropping 0")

bind_rows(with_0, dropped_0) %>% 
      rename_all(funs(gsub("_forcat_fct", "", make.names(names(with_0))))) %>% 
      kable()
```


#### Reorder levels based on knowledge from data

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
