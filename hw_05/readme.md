##### **Progress**:
This assignment took me awhile to finish. I wish I had started on it earlier. I spend the most time playing with the fct_reorder() function. I was having problems choosing the right variables to use, and which parameters to give to the command. I realized that using .desc = TRUE needed to be used to solve one of my issues.

In terms of creating plots, I always find a hard time trying to decide what is important. The first plot I creates didn't show the information I had thought it would in my head. I wanted to include these top artists in colour, and all the other artists in a gray to show the difference. But I couldn't think of an efficient way of doing that without creating different subsets.

With the reading and writing in data, it was pretty straight forward. I personally like to use wrte.table() to create all of my functions. I will probably start RDS more often now when I'm dealing with data I manipulate; I like that the variable types remain the same.
