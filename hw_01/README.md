#### Progress description

I used R studio to do all of the editing and committing for this assignment.
The assignment seemed quite easy, it took me an hour or so to complete.
I spent the most time learning the github markdown syntax. I found this [markdown
cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here.wiki.git) to be helpful.
I tried to include emojis into my README, but I noticed that only the text appeared and
not the actual emoji.

The gapminder R markdown portion I was a little confused about. I wasn't in class
on Sept 14th, so I didn't have a preexisting R markdown. I instead used the file
that was worked on in class today (Tues Sept 19). I am used to using the piping 
operator so I used that for all of the gapminder analysis. Overall the assignment 
seemed fair.
