## Homework 3: [Use dplyr to manipulate and explore data (also use ggplot2)](http://stat545.com/hw03_dplyr-and-more-ggplot2.html)
#### Due date: Oct 3, 2017

#
#### **Overview:**

 - Manipulate and explore a dataset with the dplyr package, complemented by visualizations made with ggplot2.
 
        - Gapminder data
       
 - Task menu
 
        - Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

        - Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

        - Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population.

        - How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?

        - Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent:
      
               - Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy (mean/median, some other quantile, perhaps your current age)
            
               - Determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.

        - Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class.

        - Make up your own! Between the dplyr coverage in class and the list above, I think you get the idea.
