## Homework 3: [Use dplyr to manipulate and explore data (also use ggplot2)](http://stat545.com/hw03_dplyr-and-more-ggplot2.html)
#### Due date: Oct 3, 2017

#### **Overview:**

 - Manipulate and explore a dataset with the dplyr package, complemented by visualizations made with ggplot2.
 
      - Gapminder data
       
 - Task menu
 
      - Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

      - Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

      - Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population.

      - How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?

      - Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: 
            
             - Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy (mean/median, some other quantile, perhaps your current age)
            
             - Determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.

       - Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class.

      - Make up your own! Between the dplyr coverage in class and the list above, I think you get the idea.
