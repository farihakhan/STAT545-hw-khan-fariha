## **Overview:**

The goal of this homework is to solidify data wrangling skills by working some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping.

 - Choose your own adventure
 
 - General data reshaping and relationship to aggregation
 
      - Problem: You have data in one “shape” but you wish it were in another. Usually this is because the alternative shape is superior for presenting a table, making a figure, or doing aggregation and statistical analysis.
      
      - Solution: Reshape your data. For simple reshaping, gather() and spread() from tidyr will suffice. Do the thing that it possible / easier now that your data has a new shape.

 
## **Progress report:**



Difficulties:
I noticed straight off the bad that my git pathway wasn't connecting with RStudio, so I wasn't able to push anything from this project. 

I wanted to replace the column names within the spread df without manually typing them out, but couldn't find a way to pipe it into the kable() function. I instead changed the column names in another step, which resulted in me having to create two data subsets.
