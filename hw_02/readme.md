      - Smell test the data
       
      - Explore individual variables
       
      - Explore various plot types
       
      - Use filter(), select() and %>%
       
      - But I want to do more!

I found this assignment to be quite fair. It took me a little bit longer than assignment 1, and I played with the formatting a lot more. Again, I used my local computer to do all of the edits and pushed everything from RStudio. I initially began with reformatting my project to include directories for different assignments. This made my homework repo a lot cleaner to work with and to visualise. 

Working with the actual data was easy for me, since I have a little bit of experience with using R. I chose to stick to a doing analysis with continent and life expectancy mostly just because the numbers were cleaner. I tried using a lot of different ggplots as well and found that to be straight forward also. I personally don't like to assign the ggplot() function to a variable, I only becauase I find it cleaner to have all of the parameters visable when I'm graphing things.
I'm a big fan of piping also, I find it so much easier to comprehend and work with. Tidyverse is probably my most used r package outside of this classroom.

I'm realatively new to working with R markdowns. I had a little bit of trouble figuring out the execution of my code chunks, and what different parameter settings acheived. I used different resources, and trial and error to get the final result. I was not sure how to incorporate a table into the r markdown, but I used the knitr package to do it. At this point, all my code is visable on my r markdown, but the outputs are only visable on the .md file. I'm not totally sure if this is what's normally expected.
